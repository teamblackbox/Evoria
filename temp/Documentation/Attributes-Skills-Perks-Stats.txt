Vitals
    - There is an amount of the particular vital and a max amount of the particular vital
    - Obviously you cannot increase the amount beyond the max, unless it's temporary from a potion or something

    Health <-- Affected by vitality and resistance. Used for, I dunno, staying alive. Your health goes to 0? YOU DIE IDIOT
    Stamina <-- Affected by endurance and speed. Used for attacking/blocking. Reduced when you don't eat or drink, or when you eat or drink too much.
    Fatigue <-- Affected by vitality and endurance. Used for taking damage/blocking and is reduced the longer you stay up past your sleep cycle
                <!> Not shown in status bar, but shown during battle
Level
    - (Global) experince is used to level up
    - (Global) experience is given when you do stuff, but I'm too lazy to list that stuff right now
    - Every attribute has it's own level that you bring up by doing things that are governed by that attribute, and every time you bring up that
      attribute a level, you bring up your (global) experience by a fraction based on your corruption level (by golf rules, the less you have the
      better off you are. Once you reach like 80% corruption you can no longer level up)
    - After each level, it takes more (global) experience in order to level up, starting with 50xp with levels 1-10 and doubling every ten levels
    - You are able to use level points in order to get perks
Corruption
    - Given by enemies when they land hits and the prescence of miasma
    - When the corruption level is high, you are more likely to have random outcomes in everything you do (like, literally everything, from
      battles to movement to speech). Like, your actions quite literally become more and more random.
    - You can reduce the meter by going to altars, which reduces the corruption meter to 0 (unless it's below 25%) and by using certain magic items
    - Corruption is increased more in different areas, the light level, during different times of the day, and the phase of the moon
    - Once it is full, you pretty much just lose the game as you become too unpredictable or something
Perks
    - I won't list them all here for now, because that's a ton of perks and stuff
    - Basically, once you reach a certain level and have a certain attribute level, you get perks automatically. Once that
      skill reduces after not being used for a while, the perk gradually reduces effectiveness
Abilites
    - Basically, allows you to do cool things I guess
Records
    - Records a log of everything you do, will eventually implement
