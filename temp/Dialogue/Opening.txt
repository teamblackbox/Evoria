Hello, this is rather awkward... You seem to have stumbled upon a game that can only be played
on a terminal, which is typically reserved for developers who are just trying to practice
writing code.

You may be wondering... why create a game that's only able to be played on the command line,
and one not even written in a faster language such as C++ that can allow more control options
and better performance?

Was the developer unskilled?

Was the developer just lazy?

Was the developer a dumbass?

The answer to all of these questions would be a resounding...

Yes.

Yes, the developer is a dumbass.

But apparently you are as well for starting the game in the first place, so go ahead and keep going.

Or...

You can end the game right now, and get a special reward for not playing it. A "special ending" for
completionists, if you will.

So go ahead... make your choice.
    Choices:
        1. "I want to continue!"
        2. "I didn't launch the program to play the game anyway."
    1:
        Alright, I guess you can keep going.
    2:
        Oh, okay.

        That's fine.

        I totally didn't want you to continue playing the game anyway.

        The game wasn't that fun to begin with...

        Although... it would've been nice if you actually chose to play it without being egged on...

        ...

        You know what, screw you. You get to play the game anyway.
Alright, so from your previous selection you decided to continue forward with the game.

Before you can start playing, you need to either create a new character or import an old one. So,
which one will it be?
    Choices:
        1. "I'm new..."
        2. "I've made a character before."
    1:
        Cool, dude.

        ...

        ...

        Oh, right... you have to create a character and stuff.

        Let's get this started then. Are you a guy or a girl?
            Choices:
                1. "I'm a guy."
                2. "I'm a girl."
                Default:
                    There's only two options for your sex in this game, because the game doesn't care about
                    your feelings.
        Nice.

        What's your name?
            Choices:
                (You enter your name, with max 15 characters)
            Default: (Only shown if nothing is entered) (Dialog changes are made if only numbers are entered)
                I refuse to call you:

                ()

                Choose something else.
        Neat.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Here's everything you've entered so far:

        Name: (name)
        Sex: (sex)
        Style: (style)

        Does this look correct?
            Choices:
                1. "Yep, looks fine."
                2. "No, this doesn't look fine."
                Default:
                    I said... does this look fine?
            1.
                (continue)
            2.
                Alright, what do you want to change?
                    Choices:
                        1. "I got my name wrong because I'm an idiot."
                        2. "I got my sex wrong because I'm an idiot."
                        3. "I got my style wrong because I'm an idiot."
                        Default:
                            You have successfully chose "I'm an idiot". Now, try again.
                    1.
                        (change name)
                    2.
                        (change sex)
                    3.
                        (change style)
                (loops back to checking if everything looks fine again)
        Great. Now, let's start the game.
